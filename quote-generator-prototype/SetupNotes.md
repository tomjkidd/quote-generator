# Purpose

This file is around to keep track of the build/release information that was used to create the project so that it:

* can serve as a starting point for another project
* could be automated if necessary

# Setup
## Set up Compojure Project

        lein new compojure quote-generator-prototype

The server will use Clojure to respond to HTTP requests, and this command creates artifacts that support creating the server.

### TODO:
* Get Clojure Dependencies
* Install Elm
* Get Elm dependencies
* Create app.html
* Get JS dependencies (maybe with bower?)
* Create JS/Elm boilerplate code
