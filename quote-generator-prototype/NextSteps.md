# Things to try
Now that the prototype is passed the initial hurdle of getting it running with a file-based database, I figured it's time to catalog a few improvements so that I can build on what's there so far.

I attended the Boston Clojure meetup and through that started working on an open issue for Clojars. The [Clojars]() github project seems to have a lot of code that I can learn from, including authentication, email, using SQLite, and System Components. Reading through this code might prove helpful for extending my prototype.

## Experiment with leiningen profiles

## Implement db with a relational database

## Implement db with datomic

## Create more stylish navbar

## Create components for Elm code

## Create a Client field for the Quote

## Create a note section for FeatureCatalog

## Use hiccup to turn app.html into clojure code.

## Integrate Google Signin completely.
